# SADA GCP Challenge

Thank you for providing me with interesting challenges. I have implemented 2 of the challenges given to me as I found them to be engaging. Please find my solutions to the challenges in this repository. Following are the two challenges that I have implemented.
1.  Loomings
2.  Highest Profit

I have used **Python3** as my programming language to implement both the challenges.

# Instructions to run the code

Both the challenges contain the run.bat file, which can be used to install the required libraries and run the solution code.

I have run my solution using python. If it doesn't work, please feel free to change it to pip3 or python3 in the run.bat file depending on the version of the python installed on the testing machine.
